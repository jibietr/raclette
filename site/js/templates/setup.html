          <p>Note that if you change the webcam or microphone here you may be asked to reload the browser, in which case
          you will be sent to the first page. This is totally normal. Once your webcam and microphone are selected correctly, 
          you won't need to change them again.</p>
          <p>3. Check that you can see yourself. You can check the microphone setting during your test in the next page.</p>
