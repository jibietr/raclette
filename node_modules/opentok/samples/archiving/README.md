OpenTok 2.0 Archiving Node.js Sample App
===========================================

A sample app showing use of the OpenTok 2.0 Archiving API.

This sample app is for use with a Node.js web server. 

## Prerequisites

1. node.js v0.10.x (we recommend v0.10.21)

   The OpenTok archiving API does not require Node.js. However, this sample uses Node.js as
   a web server and to make calls to the OpenTok Node.js library.

2. An OpenTok API key and secret (see <https://dashboard.tokbox.com>)

## Setup

1. Copy config/server.json.sample file to config/server.json and set the following values:

   * apiKey -- Set this to your OpenTok API key (see <https://dashboard.tokbox.com>).
   * apiSecret -- Set this to your OpenTok API secret (see <https://dashboard.tokbox.com>).

2. Copy the opentok-node.tgz file from the opentok-node-sdk root directory.

3. From the project root, run `npm install` to install the app and its dependencies.

## To run the app for yourself

From the project root, run `node app` to start the app.

Then test the app:

1. Open http://localhost:3052/ (or your server URL) in a web browser.

2. Click the "Host view" button. The Host View page publishes an audio-video stream to an
   OpenTok session. It also includes controls that cause the web server to start and stop archiving.

3. Click the Allow button to grant access to the camera and microphone.

4. Click the "Start archiving" button. The session starts recording to an archive. Note that the
   red archiving indicator is displayed in the video view.

5. Open http://localhost:3052/ in a new browser tab. (You may want to mute your computer speaker
   to prevent feedback. You are about to publish two audio-video streams from the same computer.)

6. Click the "Participant view" button. The page connects to the OpenTok session, displays
   the existing stream (from the Host View page).

7. Click the Allow button in the page to grant access to the camera and microphone. The page
   publishes a new stream to the session. Both streams are now being recorded to an archive.

8. On the Host View page, click the "Stop archiving" button.

9. Click the "past archives" link in the page. This page lists the archives that have been recorded.
   Note that it may take up to 2 minutes for the video file to become available (for a 90-minute 
   recording).

10. Click a listing for an available archive to download the MP4 file of the recording.

## Understanding the code

This sample app shows how to use the archiving API in the OpenTok 2.0 Node.js SDK.

### Starting an archive

The host-view.html file (in the views directory) includes a button for starting the archive.
When the user clicks this button, the page makes an Ajax call back to the server:

    $(".start").click(function(event){
      $.get("/start-archive");
    })

The index.js file in the routes directory handles this HTTP request (to start-archive)

    exports.startArchive = function(req, res, next) {
      req.opentok.startArchive(req.opentokSession, { name: 'Node.js Archiving Sample' },
        function(err, archive) {
        if(err) {
          util.log('Error starting archive: ' + err.message);
          return next(err);
        }
        res.send(archive);
      });
    };

This code calls the startArchive() method of the opentok object, which is an instance of the
OpenTokSDK class, defined by the OpenTok Node SDK. The startArchive method starts an archive,
and it takes two parameters:

* The sesssion ID of the OpenTok session to archive
* An options object that includes a name property (which is optional and helps identify the archive)

You can only start recording an archive in a session that has active clients connected.

In the page on the web client, the Session object (in JavaScript) dispatches an archiveStarted
event. The page stores the archive ID (a unique identifier of the archive) in an archiveID variable:

    session.on('archiveStarted', function(event) {
      archiveID = event.id;
      console.log("ARCHIVE STARTED");
      $(".start").hide();
      $(".stop").show();
    });

### Stopping an archive

The host-view.html file includes a button for stopping the archive. When the user clicks this
button, the page makes an Ajax call back to the server:

    $(".stop").click(function(event){
      $.get("/stop-archive" + archiveID);
    })

The index.js file in the routes directory handles this HTTP request (to start-archive)

    exports.stopArchive = function(req, res, next) {
      req.opentok.stopArchive(req.params.archive, function(err, archive) {
        if(err) {
          util.log('Error stopping archive: ' + err.message);
          return next(err);
        }
        res.send(archive);
      });

This code calls the stopArchive() method of the opentok object. This method stops an archive,
based on the archive ID.

In the page on the web client, the Session object (in JavaScript) dispatches an archiveStopped
event. The page stores the archive ID (a unique identifier of the archive) in an archiveID variable:

    session.on('archiveStopped', function(event) {
      archiveID = null;
      console.log("ARCHIVE STOPPED");
      $(".start").show();
      $(".stop").hide();
    });

### Listing archives

The routes/index.js file includes the following code for the past-archives.html page:

    exports.pastArchives = function(req, res, next) {
      var offset = parseInt(req.query.offset), perPage = 5;
      if(!offset || isNaN(offset)) {
        offset = 0;
      }

      req.opentok.listArchives({ count: perPage, offset: offset }, function(err, archives, total) {
        if(err) {
          util.log('Error listing archives: ' + err.message);
          return next(err);
        }
        var showPrevious, showNext;
        if(offset > 0) {
          showPrevious = '/past-archives?offset=' + ((offset - perPage > 0) ? offset - perPage : 0);
        }
        if(total > offset + perPage) {
          showNext = '/past-archives?offset=' + (offset + perPage);
        }
        res.render('past-archives', {
          offset: offset,
          archives: archives,
          showPrevious: showPrevious,
          showNext: showNext
        });
      });
    };

This code calls the listArchives() method of the opentok object. This method lists archives
created for the API key. The method takes two parameters:

* An object containing a count and an offset property. These define how many archives are listed
and which offset starts the list.
* A callback function for when the call to the method succeeds or fails. If the method succeeds,
the second parameter, archives, is set to an array of Archive objects. This object is passed on
to the client web page.

An Archive object represents an OpenTok archive, and includes the following properties:

* id -- The archive ID, which uniquely defines the archive.
* name -- The archive name.
* createdAt -- The timestamp for when the archive was created.
* duration -- The duration of the archive (in seconds).
* status -- The status of the archive. This can be one of the following:
  * "available" -- The archive is available for download from the OpenTok cloud.
  * "failed" -- The archive recording failed.
  * "started" -- The archive started and is in the process of being recorded.
  * "stopped" -- The archive stopped recording.
  * "uploaded" -- The archive is available for download from an S3 bucket you specified (see
    [Setting an archive upload target](../../../REST-API.md#set_upload_target)).
* url -- The URL of the download file for the recorded archive (if available) 

The client web page iterates through the array of archive objects, and displays
UI based on the id, name, createdAt, duration, status, and url properties of the object:

    <% archives.forEach(function(item) { %>
    
    <tr data-item-id="<%= item.id %>">
      <td><% if(item.status == 'available' && item.url) { %><a href="/download-archive/<%= encodeURIComponent(item.id) %>"><% } %><%= item.name %><% if(item.status == 'available' && item.url) { %></a><% } %></td>
      <td><%= new Date(item.createdAt) %></td>
      <td><%= item.duration %> seconds</td>
      <td><%= item.status %></td>
      <form method="post" action="/delete-archive/<%= encodeURIComponent(item.id) %>">
      <td><% if(item.status == 'available') { %><input class="btn btn-danger btn-xs" type="submit" value="Delete"><% } else { %>&nbsp;<% } %></td>
      </form>
    </tr>
    
    <% }) %>

### Downloading archives

The url property of an Archive object is the download URL for the available archive. See the
previous section, which shows how this URL is added to the past-archives.html page as a download
link.

### Deleting archives

The past-archives.html file includes buttons for deleting archives. When the user clicks one of
these buttons, the page makes an Ajax call back to the server:

    <form method="post" action="/delete-archive/<%= encodeURIComponent(item.id) %>">

The index.js file in the routes directory handles this HTTP request (to start-archive)

    exports.deleteArchive = function(req, res, next) {
      req.opentok.deleteArchive(req.params.archive, function(err) {
        if(err) {
          util.log('Error listing archives: ' + err.message);
          return next(err);
        }
        res.redirect('/past-archives');
      });
    };

This code calls the deleteArchive() method of the opentok object. This method deletes an archive,
based on the archive ID.
